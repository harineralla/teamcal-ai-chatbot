# teamcal-ai-chatbot

Please create an AI Chatbot. Use local JSON data to train the chatbot. Use Python 3.11+ and Tensorflow 2.12.0+ and the related libraries. 

Once done, integrate this with a PHP Chat so that you can send a message from the PHP app and the Python app responds to it. Bonus points If you can deploy this in AWS.
